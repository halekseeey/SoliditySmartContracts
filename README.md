# Sample Hardhat Project

This repository contains various smart contracts that I wrote during training.

To run and test, move the necessary files to the appropriate directories of the hardhat project and run

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
